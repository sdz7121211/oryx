# This file specifies all configuration parameters that can be used by Oryx.
#
# An application will typically override only a few of these. An application specifies parameter
# values by creating a config file, like myapp.conf, and then running the Computation Layer or
# Serving Layer with "java -Dconfig.file=myapp.conf ..."
#
# It is typically easiest to use simple properties file-style key-value syntax when writing a .conf
# file -- many lines of "key=value" pairs, one on each line.
#
# There are only two parameters that must be specified in any config file -- the type of model to build,
# and the location where input/output files will be stored. For example:
#
# model=${als-model}
# model.instance-dir=/your/location
#
# The rest of this file defines all parameters that can be set, and their default values.
# Note that a property like...
#
# foo = {
#   bar = 1
# }
#
# ... is set by "foo.bar=1" in key-value syntax.

# generic-api
# These parameters are common to serving-layer.api and computation-layer.api.
# You will not set values under generic-api directly. Instead, set for example "serving-layer.api.port=8080"
# to configure the port parameter, defined below, for the Serving Layer. "computation-layer.api.port" can be
# set, similarly.
